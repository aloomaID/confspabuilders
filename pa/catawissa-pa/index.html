            <h3>Catawissa, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Catawissa is twinned with Uxbridge, Ontario. The historic link began in 1805, when the Uxbridge area was granted by the British crown to Dr. Christopher Beswick, first medical doctor north of the Oak Ridges Moraine. While not a Quaker, he lived in Catawissa before moving to the Uxbridge area. Beswick Lane in the Ontario town is named after him.</p>
