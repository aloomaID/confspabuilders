                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Stinnett was established in 1926 by A.P. (Ace) Borger, better known as the founder of Borger, a larger community in the county, and his brother Lester Andrew (Pete) Borger. In September 1926, Stinnett replaced Plemons, which later became a ghost town, as the Hutchinson County seat. The courthouse, built in 1927 in the Spanish Renaissance style, was financed from petroleum money. The structure, designed by the architect W.F. Townes, consists of brown brick and cut white stone.</p>
